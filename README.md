The aim of this paper is to analyze efficiency of three classifiers
which will be experimented and compared to find out the best techniques. They
were experimented on a standard database of handwritten digit. However, not
only recognition rate is considered, but also other issues (ex. error rate,
misclassified image rate and computing time) will be analyzed. The presented
results show that CNN is the best classifier to recognize handwritten digits.
That is, the highest recognition rates (96.93%) are obtained. But the computing
time of training is the main problem for them. Conversely, other methods, like
SVM, give insignificantly worse results, but their training is much
quicker. However, all of the techniques also represent an error rate of 1â€“4%
because of confusion with digits 1 and 7 or 3, 5 and 8 respectively.
